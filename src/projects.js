  title: "Biometric Attendance & Shift Management System",
  shortDescription: "A desktop-based system for managing staff attendance and shifts using biometric verification.",
  fullDescription: `
This project was developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming coursework.
The system is designed to automate attendance tracking and shift allocation for university support staff,
reducing manual record keeping and errors.
  `,
  problemSolved: `
Manual attendance systems are prone to errors, impersonation, and poor record keeping.
Supervisors also struggle to track staff shifts across departments.
This project addresses these issues by centralizing attendance records
and introducing role-based access for staff, supervisors, and administrators.
  `,
  whatILearned: `
I learned how to design a multi-layered system using Java,
connect a desktop application to a database,
and manage user roles and sessions.
This project strengthened my understanding of OOP principles,
database integration, and real-world software constraints.

  title: "Admin Attendance & Analytics Dashboard",
  shortDescription: "A role-based dashboard for viewing and filtering attendance records across departments.",
  fullDescription: `
This project focused on building an admin-level dashboard
that allows supervisors and IT staff to monitor attendance data in real time.
The dashboard supports filtering by date, staff, and department.
  `,
  problemSolved: `
Attendance data is often scattered across multiple files or systems,
making analysis difficult.
This project centralizes attendance logs
and provides structured access based on user roles.
  `,
  whatILearned: `
I improved my understanding of data filtering,
session management,
and dashboard-style UI design.
I also learned how to design interfaces that prioritize clarity over complexity.

  title: "Personal Portfolio Website",
  shortDescription: "A responsive personal portfolio built with React to showcase my projects and skills.",
  fullDescription: `
This portfolio website was built to present my work
in a structured and professional manner.
It demonstrates my understanding of React components,
routing, and responsive design.
  `,
  problemSolved: `
Many beginner portfolios lack clear navigation
and detailed project explanations.
This project solves that by introducing dedicated project pages
and clean content organization.
  `,
  whatILearned: `
I learned how to use React Router for dynamic routing,
structure reusable components,
and deploy a frontend application.
This project improved my confidence in building production-ready UIs.
